Words occurency counter.

Run it from cmd window using switches (-i -o). Eg .\wordCounter.exe -i inputFile.txt -o outputFile.txt.

Until you see "Finished", do not close the program, let it work. After then, you can see the result in the output text file.

Input file should be in the same direcory as the program. Output will be created there.

It's recommended to use properly formated txt files from "wikisource.org".
